# Elixir Simple Math

A mix app to find the factors of a number. 

Program can be run with 
```bash
$ mix runFactors
```
and it asks you for an integer. 

You can also give it a number from the command line: 
```bash
$ mix runFactors 25
```

You can get the multiplication table up to 10:
```bash
$ mix runFactors 25 --multiplication
```

You can also find out how many kilometers there are in miles or vice versa:
```bash
$ mix runFactors 25 --kilomiles
```

Done just because I'm reading a Python math book.
